# Pipita-pacs_project
Repository for PACS project 2019-2020

This repository will contain both the project code and the project documentation.

The chosen project is project #50, "Development of an interactive 2D application with OpenFrameworks"

I will implement a simple application in which the user will use a Kinect ( model 1414) to interact with a game similar to Breakout: the player will control the moving bar with his/her hands.
Both the graphics and the interaction with the Kinect hardware will be handled via the libraries provided by openframeworks.

Currently the project is being developed in Netbeans IDE within an Ubuntu environment
