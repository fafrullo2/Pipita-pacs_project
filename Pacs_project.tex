\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This project consists in developing an application that enables the user to interact with a 2D environment via video feed.\\
In particular, the user will control via hand motion a component of a simple game: the goal of the player is to destroy a brick wall by making a ball bounce into it, while avoiding to make the ball fall off the screen. In order to do so, the player will move a bar at the bottom of the playfield via motion control.\\
The video feed will be captured via a Microsoft Kinect, mod. 1414\\

\subsection{Chapter Overview}
\subsection{Scope}
\subsection{Goals, Requirements and Domain Assumptions}
In this section the Goals, Requirements and Domain Assumption of application, as well as their relationship, will be presented
\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Goal 1: user's hand movement must be recognised as input
	\item Goal 2: the input must impact on the game environment
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Requirement 1: the system must track the player's hands
	\item Requirement 2: player's hands movement must be translated into bar movement
	\item Requirement 3: the ball entity must react to impact
	\item Requirement 4: the system must register ball-to-bricks impact
	\item Requirement 5: the system must register ball-to-boundaries impact
	\item Requirement 6: the system must register ball-to bar impact
	\item Requirement 7: the system must register the ball falling out of the playfield
	\item Requirement 8: the system must register the complete wall destruction 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Domain Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Domain Assumption 1: the user must be in possession of a functioning Microsoft Kinect model 1414 
\end{itemize}
